At Slack, like most tech companies, we depend on open source software from all over the world to help us get things done. We're grateful to the open source community, the projects, and especially their maintainers who have allowed us to innovate and make our customers working lives a little bit more enjoyable. 

Listed within this GitHub org, you'll find a collection of things built by Slack, which we think folks may find helpful or inspiring. Our published projects cover a wide range of complexity, from [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula), a scalable overlay networking tool, and [PanModal](https://github.com/slackhq/PanModal), a customizable presentation API for constructing modals on iOS, [Kaldb](https://github.com/slackhq/kaldb), for storing observability data, to a variety of tutorials and snippets to complement our engineering blog posts.

&nbsp;

In addition to publishing open source projects, Slack strives to actively participate in improving upon the core frameworks Slack is built upon, such as [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

In the words of our friends at [Salesforce](https://opensource.salesforce.com/):

>Open source drives our industry forward, kick-starts new careers, and builds trust in the products we create. From using projects, making improvements, and sharing our most impactful innovations with the community–in open source, we want to leave it better than we found it.
